# Skullcoin Treasure Hunt

Skullcoin introduces a unique Find-to-Earn concept, creating a GameFi with a sustainable economy, focusing on skill-based treasure hunting powered by meritocratic tokenomics.
This Web3 game innovates Encrypted NFTs (eNFTs) with two layers of information: public and private, to embed secret clues for players to discover, emphasizing strategy and collaboration.
The Proof-of-Game mechanism rewards players for their problem-solving skills, ensuring an equitable distribution of skullcoins without premine. On-chain mechanics based on Verifiable Random Function (VRF) ensure fairness in randomness. Designed to be resistant to AI, Skullcoin maintains a fair competition environment, promoting human creativity and interaction.
Beyond entertainment, it serves as an educational platform on blockchain and digital currencies, fostering a community of learners and adventurers, and leading to the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. Through engaging gameplay and a focus on merit, Skullcoin aims to blend gaming with educational insights into blockchain technology.
In Skullcoin's universe, where NFTs gain new life and purpose through narrative-driven quests, digital tokens showcase intrinsic value. In Find-to-Earn, the coordinates that players need to find are akin to the target hash in Bitcoin but only for human minds.
